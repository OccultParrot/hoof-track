User Story
As a user, I want to be able to see all upcoming horses I need to shoe so that I can plan my schedule accordingly.
I want the application to have multiple pages, one as a main page that shows all upcoming horses, a "horse reset" menu, a master list that lists EVERY unique upcoming horse, 
an add horse menu, and a remove horse menu, and a "view horse" menu that shows all the information about a specific horse.
I want the main page to show the horse's name, and the date it needs to be shod by
